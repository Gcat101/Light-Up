# How?
Makes all pixels that aren't the same color as the first pixel white.
# Why?
For args and for fun.
# .exe/.app files?
Unfortunately I can't compile this project (for some reason).
# How to use?
You have to install python and tick 'INSTALL PYTHON TO PATH' when you're installing. Then, write 'pip install pillow' in your command line/terminal. Finally put the picture file in the same directory as the python file and run the script.
# Simplier way?
no
